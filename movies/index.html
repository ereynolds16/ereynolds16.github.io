                <h1>"Brick" (2005)</h1>
                <h2>Dir: Rian Johnson</h2>
                <p>Starting off with a film not many people know, it's the first film from 
                director Rian Johnson (who later earned more fame with "Looper", "Knives Out", and "The Last Jedi"),
                and imagines a hard-boiled film noir detective story through the lens of a suburban high school. <br> <br>
                Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the protagonist, trying to navigate various criminal elements at his school
                in an effort to save his former girlfriend. <br> <br>
                The movie is heavy on 1930s-era slang and has a very fast-talking pace that can seem odd at first. Trust me, 
                stick with it for the first ten minutes and you'll find yourself immersed in their world. A great creative 
                vision that's a lot of fun.</p>

                <h1>"Casablanca" (1942)</h1>
                <h2>Dir: Michael Curtiz</h2>
                <p>A classic that only gets better with repeated viewings. It highlights the moral ambiguities and complexities
                that all real humans contain, particularly in times of crisis, while holding out hope for good to ultimately triumph. <br> <br>
                The famous final scene has been referenced to death, but still retains its punch given the power of the build leading up to it. 
                Bogart's restrained performance is iconic.</p>

                <h1>"2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968)</h1>
                <h2>Dir: Stanley Kubrick</h2>
                <p>An incredible achievement, doubly so considering it was released way back in 1968. It can be criticized for being
                impenetrable--while it's true it asks more questions than it answers, it is visually stunning and daringly creative. <br> <br>
                What separates intelligent life from the rest of the universe? Are increases in intelligence and technology doomed to always be accompanied by 
                increases in violence? What is the next quantum leap for the human race? This film explores these questions and many more. It will stay
                in your thoughts long, long after the credits have rolled.</p>

                <h1>"Chinatown" (1974)</h1>
                <h2>Dir: Roman Polanski</h2>
                <p>Often hailed as the greatest screenplay of all time, Jack stars as a private eye in 1930s Los Angeles whose new case gets him in over his head. 
                The film inverts typical Film Noir conventions by emphasizing the bright, cloudless sunshine, farmland, and wilderness of early LA. But the subject is pitch-black. <br> <br> 
                There are many twists and turns, with some truly shocking developments (especially for 1974)--this one always keeps you guessing, but many of the 
                clues were right in front of you the whole time. <br> <br>
                (Note: Polanski raped a child and shouldn't be celebrated, but the multitudes of other people involved in this film should be.)</p>
