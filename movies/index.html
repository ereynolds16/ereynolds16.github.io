                <h1>"Brick" (2005)</h1>
                <h2>Dir: Rian Johnson</h2>
                <p>Starting off with a film not many people know, it's the first film from 
                director Rian Johnson (who later earned more fame with "Looper", "Knives Out", and "The Last Jedi"),
                and imagines a hard-boiled film noir detective story through the lens of a suburban high school. <br> <br>
                Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the protagonist, trying to navigate various criminal elements at his school
                in an effort to save his former girlfriend. <br> <br>
                The movie is heavy on 1930s-era slang and has a very fast-talking pace that can seem odd at first. Trust me, 
                stick with it for the first ten minutes and you'll find yourself immersed in their world. A great creative 
                vision that's a lot of fun.</p>

                <h1>"Casablanca" (1942)</h1>
                <h2>Dir: Michael Curtiz</h2>
                <p>A classic that only gets better with repeated viewings. It highlights the moral ambiguities and complexities
                that all real humans contain, particularly in times of crisis, while holding out hope for good to ultimately triumph. <br> <br>
                The famous final scene has been referenced to death, but still retains its punch given the power of the build leading up to it. 
                Bogart's restrained performance is iconic.</p>

                <h1>"2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968)</h1>
                <h2>Dir: Stanley Kubrick</h2>
                <p>An incredible achievement, doubly so considering it was released way back in 1968. It can be criticized for being
                impenetrable--while it's true it asks more questions than it answers, it is visually stunning and daringly creative. <br> <br>
                What separates intelligent life from the rest of the universe? Are increases in intelligence and technology doomed to always be accompanied by 
                increases in violence? What is the next quantum leap for the human race? This film explores these questions and many more. It will stay
                in your thoughts long, long after the credits have rolled.</p>

                <h1>"Chinatown" (1974)</h1>
                <h2>Dir: Roman Polanski</h2>
                <p>Often hailed as the greatest screenplay of all time, Jack stars as a private eye in 1930s Los Angeles whose new case gets him in over his head. 
                The film inverts typical Film Noir conventions by emphasizing the bright, cloudless sunshine, farmland, and wilderness of early LA. But the subject is pitch-black. <br> <br> 
                There are many twists and turns, with some truly shocking developments (especially for 1974)--this one always keeps you guessing, but many of the 
                clues were right in front of you the whole time. <br> <br>
                (Note: Polanski raped a child and shouldn't be celebrated, but the multitudes of other people involved in this film should be.)</p>

                <h2>Dir: David Anspaugh</h2>
                <p>Slightly cheesy, but I always found this movie inspiring, especially as a kid. The message of absolute determination, and the drive to do whatever it takes to attain a goal,
                    that always struck a chord. If the scene of him opening his acceptance letter doesn't make you choke up, then you are not a human being.</p>

                <h1>"Groundhog Day" (1993)</h1>
                <h2>Dir: Harold Ramis</h2>
                <p>Bill Murray is perfect as a prickish weatherman forced to live the same day over and over. The movie covers a surprisingly wide range of tones and emotions, moving from 
                    comedy to frustration to rage to pitiful depression, and finally to dignified acceptance. <br> <br> 
                    The final act could have been a cliche, but it feels rightfully earned: he has truly gone through the ringer and come out the other side to embrace the importance of 
                    kindness and human connection.
                    <br> <br> ...Also it's just funny as hell.

                <h1>"Swingers" (1996)</h1>
                <h2>Dir: Doug Liman</h2>
                <p>A great exploration of what it's like to be a single guy in your 20s trying to figure things out. Loosely based on Favreau's actual experience as a fresh LA transplant and 
                    struggling actor, this  launched the careers of both Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn (who met on the set of "Rudy"...). The Old Hollywood aesthetic, Rat Pack subculture, 
                    and early swing were a breath of fresh air in the grunge-filled 90s. <br> <br> 
                    The movie has a surprising amount of heart--with the right friends, you can get through the toughest of times and through to the other side.

                <h1>"High Fidelity" (2000)</h1>
                <h2>Dir: Stephen Frears</h2>
                <p>This is a back-to-back selection in the "Young Guys Reflecting on Romantic Failures" genre, but I can't not include it. John Cusack is great as an everyman
                    record geek who has had ups and downs with women. When a breakup throws him for a loop, he makes the extremely bad decision to track down all his ex-girlfriends  
                    to see if they can offer any advice. (This was obviously before social media. But still.)<br> <br>
                    This movie also doubles as a tourism ad for Chicago, Cusack's home town. Watching always reminds me of the great times I had living there. Miss ya, Chi-town!

                <h2>Dir: Ridley Scott</h2>
                <p>An incredible vision of the future, Ridley Scott's film mixes a film noir detective story with science fiction. Harrison Ford must track down a group of rogue androids
                    called "Replicants" that are indistinguishable from humans. In addition to the amazing set design and aesthetic, the movie ponders: "What does it mean to be human?"

                <h2>Dir: Christopher Nolan</h2>
                <p>The movie that introduced the world to Christopher Nolan plays with narrative structure in an amazingly innovative way. Our protagonist can only remember the most 
                    recent few minutes of his life, thus the story is told by going backward: how did he end up in the situation of the opening scene? Guy Pearce is excellent as a 
                    man devastated by the loss of his wife, determined to avenge her, and driven mad by the inability to make new memories. Endlessly entertaining. <br> <br>
                    Nolan went on to explore innovative ways of playing with time in narrative in "Inception", "Interstellar", and "Dunkirk".
